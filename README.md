# sawtooth-contrib

The sawtooth-contrib repository contains contributed software for
[Hyperledger Sawtooth](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/), a platform for
building distributed ledgers.

This repository is intended for community-contributed software, including
example libraries, applications, and reference implementations for  transaction
families (Sawtooth's version of smart contracts). This software is designed to
work with the Hyperledger Sawtooth platform software in the [sawtooth-core
repository](https://github.com/hyperledger/sawtooth-core).


## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions to this repository, either as changes to existing
software or as new example tools and reference implementations. Please follow
the [guidelines for
contributing](https://sawtooth.hyperledger.org/community/contributing/). For
more information, please join the [#sawtooth discussion
channel](https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/sawtooth) or [Hyperledger Sawtooth
mailing list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/sawtooth).
